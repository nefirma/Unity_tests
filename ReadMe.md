1. Procedurally create a model of a rectangular flag canvas with a given grid resolution.
The number of vertices horizontally and vertically must be given by a variable. The flag model should consist of triangles.
2. Create our own shader that will apply an arbitrary texture to the entire surface of the flag.
3. Using the resulting model:
    Perform canvas animation in the form of waves.
    Implement horizontally scrolling flag texture animation.
4. There should be both implementations:
    In a script inside Unity3D (CPU)
    In a pixel and vertex shader (GPU)
